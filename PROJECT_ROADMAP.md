# Tequila Sunrise Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
Tequila Sunrise is an AR mobile application that allows users to control a pixel-style avatar in augmented reality environments and interact with a motorcycle. The avatar can move around AR surfaces, jump, and ride the motorcycle, creating an immersive AR experience.

## Major Milestones

### Milestone 1: Project Setup and Core AR Functionality (TS-M1)
**Target Completion: Sprint 1-2**
- Setup project repository and branching strategy
- Configure Unity project with AR Foundation
- Implement basic AR surface detection and visualization
- Create project documentation and style guide
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for testing

### Milestone 2: Avatar Implementation (TS-M2)
**Target Completion: Sprint 3-4**
- Import and configure pixel avatar model and animations
- Implement avatar controller with physics
- Create mobile UI controls (joystick, buttons)
- Implement avatar placement in AR
- Add jumping and movement capabilities

### Milestone 3: Motorcycle Implementation (TS-M3)
**Target Completion: Sprint 5-6**
- Import and configure motorcycle model
- Implement motorcycle physics (wheel colliders, suspension, steering)
- Create flat surface detection for motorcycle spawning
- Add motorcycle-avatar interaction (mounting/dismounting)
- Implement motorcycle controls

### Milestone 4: Physics and Interaction Refinement (TS-M4)
**Target Completion: Sprint 7-8**
- Refine avatar physics and movement
- Improve motorcycle physics simulation
- Enhance surface detection and plane mapping
- Optimize collision handling
- Fine-tune control responsiveness

### Milestone 5: Polish and Optimization (TS-M5)
**Target Completion: Sprint 9-10**
- Add visual effects for interactions
- Optimize performance for mobile devices
- Improve UI/UX and feedback
- Fix bugs and issues
- Prepare for release
