## Task Description
We need to update our progress tracking methodology to use GitHub issues instead of the Task Progress sheet. This will provide better integration with our development workflow, improve visibility, and make it easier to track the status of tasks.

## Subtasks
- [x] Create GitHub issue templates
- [x] Create GitHub workflow for issue tracking
- [ ] Migrate existing tasks from TASK_PROGRESS.md to GitHub issues
- [ ] Update README with new progress tracking information
- [ ] Set up GitHub project board for kanban-style visualization
- [ ] Document the new workflow process

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tasks are tracked in GitHub issues
- [ ] GitHub project board is set up
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect new process
- [ ] Team members can easily create, update, and track tasks

## Dependencies
None

## Implementation Notes
This change will help us maintain a cleaner project structure and ensure that tasks are properly tracked through completion. It will also make it easier to understand the current state of the project.

## Testing Notes
Verify that the GitHub Actions workflow works correctly for new issues and PRs.
