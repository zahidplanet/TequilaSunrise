## Task Description
There are several compiler errors in the project that need to be fixed before we can proceed with further development. The main issues include missing dependencies like LeanTween which is referenced in multiple scripts but not imported, and potential namespacing issues.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Add missing LeanTween package to the project
- [ ] Fix namespace references across scripts
- [ ] Resolve any interface implementation issues
- [ ] Test all components to ensure they compile correctly
- [ ] Document required dependencies in README

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All scripts compile without errors
- [ ] Required packages are documented
- [ ] Project can be built successfully

## Dependencies
None

## Implementation Notes
We should prioritize fixing these issues before adding more functionality, as we're currently building on an unstable foundation.

## Testing Notes
After fixing the compiler errors, test on both the Unity Editor and a sample build to ensure everything works as expected.
