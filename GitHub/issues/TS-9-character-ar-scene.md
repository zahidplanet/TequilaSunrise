## Task Description
We need to create a complete AR test scene with the main pixel character and motorcycle controls. Currently, there is a mismatch between the code implementation and actual scene setup, which is causing confusion and preventing proper testing.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create a Prefabs folder structure
- [ ] Import the TS_PixelAvatarMain model
- [ ] Set up character animations
- [ ] Create a character controller prefab
- [ ] Create a motorcycle prefab
- [ ] Set up the AR test scene with plane detection
- [ ] Add mobile input controls to the scene
- [ ] Test character movement and interactions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A functioning AR test scene with plane detection
- [ ] Character prefab with animations and controls
- [ ] Motorcycle prefab that the character can interact with
- [ ] Mobile controls that work properly
- [ ] No compiler errors

## Dependencies
- Mobile input system (TS-6)
- AR Foundation setup (TS-2)

## Implementation Notes
We need to focus on creating a complete working test setup rather than continuing to implement individual components in isolation without testing the full integration.

## Testing Notes
Test on both iOS and Android devices to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
